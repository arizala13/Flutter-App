# Flutter Journal

This is a flutter journal example. You can add entries and it will populate the date and you can also attach a picture for that date.

Later on I want to add

- Daily prompts that are randomized
- Stoic quotes that load lazy.
- Be able to search for dates instead of scrolling to find that date.
